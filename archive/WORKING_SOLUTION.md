```

### Restart if Needed  
```bash
sudo docker restart jd-fleet-manager
```

## 🔗 **Domain Setup (Optional Future Step)**
```
The system works perfectly on port 3000. If you want to set up 
https://jd-fleet-manager.laikadynamics.com later, we can:

1. Add CNAME record: jd-fleet-manager → your-server-ip
2. Configure Traefik routing in Coolify
3. Keep port 3000 as backup access

For now, use http://194.238.17.65:3000 - it's ready immediately!
```

## 🔒 **Security Notes**
- ✅ **Isolated deployment** - Won't affect Coolify services
- ✅ **Auto-restart enabled** - Survives server reboots  
- ✅ **Persistent data** - Configurations saved in volumes
- ✅ **Production mode** - Optimized for performance

## 📊 **What This Solves**
- ❌ **Android 15 restrictions** → ✅ **Direct device access**
- ❌ **TeamViewer limitations** → ✅ **Professional fleet management**  
- ❌ **Manual tablet support** → ✅ **Centralized dashboard**
- ❌ **No remote diagnostics** → ✅ **Full remote control**
